# jonnowitts.com Version 2018
The time has come again for a fresh new design and code build-out of jonnowitts.com. This time I'll be using Git along the way to document the progress as I go. I think this is probably version 3 or 4, although not all versions of my site have made it to the web so in reality this is probably version 6.

The current roadmap is:
* v1 Flat HTML structure, basic pages, no blog
* v2 Angular (4, current as of time of writing) built over the top, code modularised
* v3 TBD CMS (likely to be Wordpress but this may, and hopefully will, change to something .net based)
