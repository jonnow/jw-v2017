jonnowitts.com Version 2017
The time has come again for a fresh new design and code build-out of jonnowitts.com. This time I'll be using Git along the way to document the progress as I go.

The current roadmap is:
- v1 Flat HTML structure, basic pages, no blog
- v2 Angular (4, current as of time of writing) built over the top, code modularised
- v3 TBD CMS (likely to be Wordpress but this may, and hopefully will, change to something .net based)
